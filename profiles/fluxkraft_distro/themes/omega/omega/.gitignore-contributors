# This .gitignore file is only relevant for maintainers and contributors. As we
# are not allowed to host any external libraries on d.o we had to integrate
# Bower into our workflow. This means that we pull in the external libraries
# only on demand. This is actually a nice feature, however, in order to not
# disrupt the git workflow of our users (by adding an actual .gitignore entry
# for the 'components' folder) we should instead add a .gitignore entry to our
# global, personal .gitignore files (~/.gitingore) instead.
