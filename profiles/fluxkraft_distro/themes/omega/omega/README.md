# Omega base theme

Omega 4.x is a modern, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and
[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) enabled Drupal 7 base theme.

## Installation

In order to install Omega 4.x, simply place it in your sites theme folder
(normally located at sites/all/themes). Omega 4.x is a base theme and as such
should **never** be used or modified directly. Instead, you should use the
[sub-theming functionality](https://drupal.org/node/225125) provided by Drupal.

The easiest way to create a new Omega-based sub-theme is by using
[Drush](http://drupal.org/project/drush). Omega comes with a very easy-to-use
Drush command for generating sub-themes through a command-line wizard. You can
start the sub-theme creation wizard by invoking `drush omega-wizard` in the
command-line.

## Documentation

The [Omega 4.x documentation](https://drupal.org/node/1768686) is hosted on
[drupal.org](http://drupal.org) as part of the handbook section. Please note
that we are still in the process of writing the documentation. If you want to
